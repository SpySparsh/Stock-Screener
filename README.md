# 📈 Real-Time Small Cap Stock Screener

A personal-use, real-time stock screener tailored for U.S. small-cap equities using the Alpaca Market Data API (IEX feed). It dynamically filters and streams only the most relevant tickers using key intraday trading metrics, including 5-min Relative Volume, Gap %, HOD breaks, and halt detection.

⚡ Built for premarket and intraday momentum scanning — inspired by Warrior Trading-style tools.

## 🚀 Features
Real-Time Trade Streaming via Alpaca's WebSocket (IEX feed)

5-Minute Relative Volume (RVOL) — Scans for current momentum vs historical volume

Gap % Filter — Measures open price vs prior close to detect gappers

Daily Relative Volume (10-day avg) — Filters for high-interest tickers

High of Day (HOD) Breaks — Highlights fresh breakout moves

Halt Detection & Resume Alerts — Flags stocks resuming after a halt

Frontend Table UI (React + Tailwind) that updates instantly via Socket.IO

Symbol auto-refresh every minute — stays dynamic without page reload

### 🧩 Backend (Node.js)
Connects to Alpaca WebSocket for real-time trade data

Every minute:

Fetches top U.S. tickers using snapshots

Computes:

5-min relative volume (rvol5min)

Gap % (today open vs yesterday close)

10-day average volume

Filters stocks based on trading strategy

Emits trade events to the frontend via Socket.IO

### 🧩 Frontend (React)
Connects via Socket.IO

Displays a real-time table of trades with:

Symbol, Price, Size

5-min % Change, 5-min RVOL, Daily RVOL, Volume, Gap %

Strategy tags (HOD Break, Halt Resume)

### 🧪 Example Filters Used
Price: $1–20

5-Min RVOL: ≥ 1.0

Daily RVOL: ≥ 1.0

Gap %: configurable

Momentum: 5-min % change positive

Premarket Volume: inferred from 5-min bars

## 🧠 HOW EACH PART WORKS
### 1. 📡 Alpaca Integration
WebSocket (v2/iex)
Connected during regular trading hours (9:30am–4:00pm ET)

Receives real-time trades from IEX exchange

Emits them to frontend over Socket.IO

REST Polling (Fallback)
Runs every 5 seconds to fetch the latest trade

Works even during pre-market and after-hours

Emits polled data to frontend as a simulated real-time feed

You’re currently using the REST polling approach for 24/7 updates.

### 2. 🧠 Backend (Node.js + Express + Socket.IO)
Handles API keys using a .env file securely

Connects to Alpaca API (WebSocket or REST)

Emits trade data to all connected users via Socket.IO

Accepts frontend connections from http://localhost:5173

Also logs key events like connection/authentication for debugging

### 3. ⚛️ Frontend (React + Vite + Tailwind)
Connects to backend via socket.io-client

Listens for trade events like:

```
{ S: 'TSLA', p: 180.52, s: 100, t: 'timestamp' }
```
Renders them into a live-updating table

Table shows: Symbol, Price, Size, and Timestamp


## 📎 Notes
Uses Alpaca's IEX feed (free, not SIP) — suitable for personal projects

Data starts at 8:00 AM ET (premarket); no full 4:00 AM coverage

Not intended for production use or financial decisions
